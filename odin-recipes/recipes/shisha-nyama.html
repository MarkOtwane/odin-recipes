    <h1>Shisha Nyama</h1>
        <!---<img src="Shisha Nyama.jpg">-->
    <p>Not just any food, but braai (barbecued) meat that's been prepared at a shisa nyama. Shisa nyama, which literally means burnt meat in Zulu, is the term used in townships to describe where people make and serve the braais.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>170gr Tobacco (as you like)</li>
        <li>190gr Glycerin (~99,5%, vegetable - HINT: some horsefoodshops sell that cheap in best quality)</li>
        <li>200gr Honey (cheap is enaugh, clear)</li>
        <li>40gr Water</li>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Aroma needs a little time to get real strength but you mixed it up warm so it's okay to have a smoke tommorow.</li>

            <li>After two weeks it's the best tobacco in the world I know. Maybe for you too?</li>
                
            <li>The Honey needs also a little time to show it's full richness of flavour so don't worry.</li>
                
            <li>Honey don't burn that ease if you warm it up with glycerin and WATER that's another reason to make sure you make a good heated molasses.</li>
                
            <li>And ... a mix of orient and burley tobacco is always a superb smokingsession for tobaccolovers.</li>
            <li>I'm happy if you show it here if you do that by your own</li>
        </ol>   
     </ul>
